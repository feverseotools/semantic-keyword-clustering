# requirements.txt for Advanced Semantic Keyword Clustering Streamlit App

# Core dependencies
streamlit>=1.29.0
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0  # For TF-IDF, PCA, KMeans, NearestNeighbors, Cosine Similarity
scipy>=1.10.0         # For hierarchical clustering components
plotly>=5.18.0        # For visualizations
matplotlib>=3.7.0     # Support for Plotly visualizations

# NLP libraries
nltk>=3.8.1          # For tokenization, stopwords, lemmatization
textblob>=0.17.1     # Alternative preprocessing fallback

# Semantic embeddings
sentence-transformers==2.2.2  # Pinned to a specific version for stability

# OpenAI and advanced preprocessing (optional, install as needed)
openai>=1.6.0           # For OpenAI embeddings and cluster naming
spacy>=3.7.0            # For advanced language preprocessing

# PDF generation
reportlab>=3.6.12     # For PDF generation
pillow>=9.3.0         # For image handling
kaleido>=0.2.1        # For static Plotly image export

# Post-installation steps:
# 1. Download NLTK data:
#    python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('wordnet'); nltk.download('omw-1.4')"
# 
# 2. Download spaCy models as needed:
#    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm  # English
#    python -m spacy download fr_core_news_sm  # French
#    python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm  # German
#    python -m spacy download es_core_news_sm  # Spanish
#    python -m spacy download pl_core_news_sm  # Polish
#    # Add other models as needed based on your language requirements
#
# 3. Create a 'models' directory at the root of your project:
#    mkdir -p ./models
#    This will be used for caching SentenceTransformer models when downloading fails
